# CGDAMDA
# A novel miRNA-disease association prediction model based on an adaptive content-guided fusion mechanism and DilateFormer

## Requirements

CGDAMDA is tested to work under:

python == 3.9

pytorch ==2.1.0+cu118

torch-geometric == 2.5.2

scipy == 1.13

numpy == 1.26.4

sklearn == 1.4.2

pandas == 2.1.4

matplotlib == 3.8.2

## Running the Code

Execute **main_hmdd20.py**  or **main_hmdd32.py** to run the code

## Note

```
Torch-geometric has a strong dependency, so it is recommended to install a matching version.
```
